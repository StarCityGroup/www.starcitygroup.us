```text
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/

This website is built with Astro, which looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

The `src/content/` directory contains collections of related Markdown and MDX documents, primarily blog posts and project descriptions.

Any static assets, like images, are placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
