This paper is the first output from our ongoing work with the Urban Tech Hub @ Cornell Tech, and identifies key ethical dilemmas shaping the future of networks, sensing, and computation in cities.

> This discussion paper explores the emerging territory of urban tech. First, it reviews _definitions_ of urban tech, to develop a consensus view of what the field covers—the who, what, when, and where or urban tech. Second, it attempts to summarize the shared _aims_ of urban tech. This effort is more of a proposition, extrapolating from the stated goals of urban tech practitioners and advocates. Finally, the most speculative part of the paper frames a set of open questions, tensions, and dilemmas dealing with the _ethics_ of urban tech. For while we know technology has always been an essential part of urban success, it has also been a tool of oppression, exclusion, and outright destruction of cities as well.
