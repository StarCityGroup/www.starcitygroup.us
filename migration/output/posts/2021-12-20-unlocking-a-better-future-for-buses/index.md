[BusWatching](https://medium.com/bus-watching?source=post_sidebar--------------------------post_sidebar--------------) is a micro-publication highlighting the thinking and work of a bus data working group we've been building at Cornell Tech throughout 2020–2021, continuing into 2022.

1. The first article, [**“Can Better Data Unlock A Bright Future for Buses?”**](https://medium.com/p/1f1bcea7092d), provides background on the project — its inspiration, its aims, and its importance.
2. The second article, [**“The Bigness of Bus Data”**](https://medium.com/p/a65a276ba2e1), digs into the techniques we developed to retrieve, store, and distribute data on the operations of New York City buses.
3. Article three, [**“From Sensing to Sensemaking: Models, Analytics, and Visualizations”**](https://medium.com/p/896bb42cf39f), explores student work in modeling, analytics, and visualization built on top of this data. These demonstrate the potential of what easy access to longitudinal data about buses can unlock — these include:  
    \- a _diff_\-style **data analysis tool** for comparing performance of bus service by route and period  
    \- a **predictive model** for understanding the impact of service disruptions on nearby subway lines on bus crowding;  
    \- a **predictive model** exploring interactions between severe heat and rainfall, inadequate shelters at bus stops, and ridership  
    \- an **interactive map-based data visualization** of the entire New York City bus system
4. Finally, article four, [**“Towards A Global Bus Observatory”**](https://medium.com/p/822111845e54) lays out our vision and plan for 2022, and the opportunities and technical challenges we anticipate in the year ahead.
