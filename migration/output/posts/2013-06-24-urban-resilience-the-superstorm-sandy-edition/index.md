"Are we in the process of tearing down the walls of the post-industrial city? Or is nature doing it for us?"

Over the last 20 years, New York City has faced a series of challenges that both tested and amplified its physical, social, and economic resilience. In this talk, Anthony Townsend highlights the role of telecommunications networks in the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy, and the surprising way that grassroots geeks are thinking up new ways to keep the bits flying when the lights go out.

Filmed in Brooklyn at PopTech.org's _The City Resilient_ conference, organized in partnership with the Brooklyn Academy of Music and the Rockefeller Foundation.
