## About Us

working with us

## Our Principles

##### **We are ethical.**

We put people before profits. That isn’t always easy, and sometimes means we lose business. But we’ll try to change your point of view first.

##### **We don't just talk.**

We don’t just talk about urban technology. We code, design space, prototype hardware, write charters, and deploy networks.

##### We are a dynamic team.

We gather the right team for every project. Our collaborators hail from diverse geographies and disciplines.

##### We focus on you.

We typically only take on a single project at a time. That means if we’re working with you, we’re focused exclusively on you.
