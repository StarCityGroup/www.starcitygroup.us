There are thousands of tech enterprises in New York City. They range in size from big companies to small startups. University research centers and government innovation agencies play a part, too. Most tech stars focus on traditional industry sectors and policy areas. But some focus on the city itselfâ€”they create urban tech. Urban tech cuts across old boundaries. It delivers innovations that make cities everywhere more connected, livable, efficient, fair and accessible.

To create this analysis of New York City's new urban tech ecosystem, we screened thousands of tech enterprises throughout the five boroughs (learn more about our methodology here). To date, we have identified 510 engaged in urban tech. These were organized into eight categories of essential urban systems for buildings, food, energy, mobility and more. Two more categories cover innovations and resources that push everyone in urban tech forward.
