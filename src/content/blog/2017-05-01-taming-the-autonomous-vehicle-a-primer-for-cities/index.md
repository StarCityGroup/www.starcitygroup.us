In 2017, we developed a primer for 10 global cities working with the Bloomberg Philanthropies on long-term planning for AVs.

This briefing book ([PDF](https://www.bbhub.io/dotorg/sites/2/2017/05/TamingtheAutonomousVehicleSpreadsPDF.pdf)) offers insights on the big trends taking shape in AVs, and the consensus among experts about the nature and pace of future developments over the next 15-20 years. It provides comprehensive and user-friendly information on:

- the various types of AVs and how they work;

- key milestones and tipping points in the spread of AVs;

- emerging hotspots for urban AV innovation;

- key demographic and regulatory drivers of AV adoption;

- who is developing the technology; and

- benefits, risks, and unintended consequences of AVs.
