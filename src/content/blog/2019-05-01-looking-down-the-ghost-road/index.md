Google's self-driving car project turns ten this year, but we're as far away from a driverless future as ever. Or so it seems.

In this sneak preview of the forthcoming book _[Ghost Road: Beyond the Driverless](https://www.ghostroadbook.com)_ car, Anthony Townsend explains how everything we've been told about autonomous vehicles is turning out wrong. We won't wake up tomorrow and find ourselves surrounded by silent, smooth-running, self-driving cars humming along in synchronization. Instead, three big stories will define the driverless future--specialization, materialization, and financialization. Together, they will give rise a world of mobility that's both more chaotic, yet more useful and delightful than ever.
